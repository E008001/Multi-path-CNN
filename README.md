Multi – path Convolution Neural Network for Lung Cancer Detection
## The Problem 
The United States accounts for the loss of approximately 225,000 people each year due to lung cancer, with an added monetary loss of $12 billion dollars each year. The office of the Vice President allots a special concentration of effort in the direction of early detection of lung cancer, since this can increase survival rate of the victims. In accordance with Kaggle & ‘Booz, Allen, Hamilton’, they host a competition on Kaggle for detecting malignant blobs and nodules in the CT scans of patients by devising powerful machine learning algorithm. Being an interesting problem, providing a wide range of approaches for devising a solution, we (the team) decided to work on the Data Science Bowl 2017 problem
